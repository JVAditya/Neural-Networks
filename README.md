# Neural-Networks

This is a basic project where neural networks are implemented. 
1. Neural Network having a single layer - accuracy 84%
2. Neural Network containing 2 convolutional layers(including maxpooling) - accuracy 97%
3. (Under implementation) Language processing - producing auto completions for sentences using Recurrent Neural Networks(to understand the context)
